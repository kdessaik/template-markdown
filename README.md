Born in Goma, NK, DRC, grow up in several neighboring countries
(Uganda,Rwanda,Kenya). A student who wants to know the deep of the economy to
help his country. East Africa contries have a strong economy compare to centre
africa contries.

So, For us, congoleses who live in these centre contries, must travel to East
Afica contries so that we get "how these contries develop them selves" My
mission is to understand their economy so that I back to my country to develop
it.

**My country: RDCongo**
